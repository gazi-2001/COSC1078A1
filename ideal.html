            I would like to work as a database administrator. So, what is a database administrator? A database administrator is a key member of an organization's IT team. They are responsible for ensuring the organization's databases and related applications operate effectively and sustainably. This job was posted by Rubix Solutions Pty Ltd, where their client who is an uprising consultancy firm needs an experienced database administrator. This job gives me the opportunity to work with premier ASX listed customers. Right now, the market cap of ASX is A$ 2.3 trillion and there are some of the largest companies listed under ASX such as BHP Group Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, CSL Ltd etc. Firstly, this job position caught my eyes because the pay is amazing, a whopping A$150k + Super. It also gives me the opportunity to work with a consultancy firm, whose main job is to consult other companies in order to maximize profits efficiently by advising them by using software that can recognize trends in the business. In my opinion working with a consultancy firm and helping them maximize other ASX listed customerâ€™s profits through programming will not only help me in my IT career but also help me understand how a business works, how a decision affects the business. It also has a hybrid work model and has career growth opportunities through internal promotion. This job also gives me the chance to work with one of the most well-known fortune 500 companies globally. In this job, an experience of more than 5 years in database administration is required along with log shipping, DB mirroring and SQL Always-On. I also need to know how to review, increase and develop backup strategies using SLA requirements. I must know how to design and maintain High availability solutions and need to plan on production, UA, QA, DEV and DR environments. I have to have knowledge on Azure, back up and restore management, Data security management and configurations and cloud migration. I must know how to assess business and system database needs. But, currently I do not have any qualifications for this job, but I will learn about all of this after the completion of my Bachelor of IT course here at RMIT through collaboration, working hard, self-learning and try and use my problem solving skills in order to get there. Hopefully in my last year of this course, I will apply for an internship as a database administrator which might help kickstart my career and help me gain experience and help me understand how this job position works better.
