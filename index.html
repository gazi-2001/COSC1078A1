                Hey, I am Gazi Mohaimenul Hoque, well people usually call me Gazi so you can call me that! I am currently in my first year here at RMIT completing my Bachelors of IT. My student number is s3874656 @student.rmit.edu.au. I am from Bangladesh which is in South Asia beside India. I finished up until grade 10 in Bangladesh and then finished my foundation studies here at RMIT as well. I am a bilingual in Bengali and English of course. Back in Bangladesh I used to play football or as Australians might call it soccer but after coming here, I had not had much of a chance to play soccer. I am also very much into weightlifting. Well, very much would be an understatement. To me, weightlifting is discipline. It helps me keep my focus on everyday life and most importantly I feel good about myself. I used to work at an NGO where we used to collect clothes and funds for people who are less privileged. I also worked at a marketing firm called The Koala Hub where I was an officer and had to organize events, land sponsorships, suggest certain changes in businesses using analytics to maximize profits. I love dogs. I have two back home and they are named  CoCo and Berry and oh god I miss them so much. Bangladesh is a very culturally mixed country with roots from India and Pakistan so the food over there is extraordinary! Since I am a fitness enthusiast, I love food, especially meat because PROTEIN!! In my free time I like to play video games, preferably Call of Duty and GTA online with my buddies or I just love to go out and eat.

                I was always a big DC fan and I used to watch a lot of movies where hackers were involved or robots, so I always had this fascination of creating cool tech. From a very young age I used to work with computers, patching video games, upgrading my computer every year by myself, whether it be installing a new hard drive, a new processor or even a graphics card. So, it is safe to say that I was always around computers and tech my whole life. As I was growing up, I became more and more keen to learn how augmented reality works, how artificial intelligence worked and gradually I decided that I wanted to study IT for my bachelors and work with AI and augmented reality. Although I do not have any experience in the developer’s side whatsoever, I am very keen to learn about it.

                While I had many friends going to Canada, I always had this fascination for Australia, mostly because of the weather. So, while searching for pathways in Australia, I found out about RMIT. RMIT was a perfect fit for me because I saw that they are affiliated with some of the largest companies in the world so in order to get a shot at those, I chose RMIT. I always dreamt big because in my opinion, if you do not dream big, you will not have the motivation to succeed. Shoot for the stars aim for the moon and you might find yourself somewhere in between even if you do not reach the moon.

                Personally, I do not want to work a 9 to 5 my entire life but we must start somewhere. During my 3-year course here at RMIT I expect to learn as much as I can about things related to programming and then move on to machine learning, AI or Augmented reality. I also have an interest in cyber security but let us see what happens. I do not know what the future holds for me but I am willing to do as much as I can to get where I want to be. The Top.

                The Myers-Briggs test suggests that my personality type has an uncanny ability to pick up on people's underlying motivations and beliefs. I am motivated by a sincere wish to do the right thing rather than a desire to manipulate or have power over other people. ENFJ's communicate with eloquence and sensitivity that are nearly impossible to ignore. When Protagonists care about someone, they want to help solve that person's problems – sometimes at any cost. People with this personality type are devoted altruists ready to face slings and arrows in order to stand up for the people and ideas that they believe in. 
                The Online Learning Test suggests that I do something physical as you study such as tapping a pencil or squeezing a stress ball. Make extensive use of a computer and the Internet to keep your mind active. If you find it difficult to sit at a desk when studying, try lying on your stomach or back.
                The Big Five test suggests that I like to think out of the norm and love playing with ideas. With that I also am very impulsive and can easily lose focus. The test also suggests that I am an introvert, but I put other’s needs in front mine and am very hospitable and lastly that I react to negative situations more.

                According to these results, when forming teams, I think I would be able to lead them, but I will need time to settle in with my peers. But once I settle in, I would be able to take very good care of them and will help the team achieve something greater in a positive way. Though it has its negative side, if I am under pressure, I would freak out so will need my peer’s assistance to recover.

                While forming teams, I should seek people who are more outgoing and have similar interests as I am so that its easier for me to settle in and communicate with them.
