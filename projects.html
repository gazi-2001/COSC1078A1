            Elevate is the next generation fitness tracking package that will work as an eco-system. It will consist of a phone app, a weight machine, a special phone case and an electronic wrist band. All these four items will then be connected to each other and work as an ecosystem. Although there are a lot of fitness tracking devices such as Fitbit and calorie tracking apps such as MyFitnessPal and workout trackers such as GymShark Training none these are quite that accurate and none of these does not take many real-life situations such as the range of movement and the speed of each rep into account thus it does not provide us with accurate results all the time.

            Research suggests that only 30.2% of the adults in the US does strength training and of these 30.2%, 90% quits after just hitting the gym for 3 months due to lack of motivation or because they do not see any progress. While some are blessed to have trainers, not all of us can do that. The only way to stay motivated to workout and be on a routine is if you see changes in your body and in order to bring these changes, tracking your work out, progressive overload, form and tracking your calorie matters a lot. This is something that I must battle every day, and I know how it feels. And using so many different apps for tracking my fitness, sometimes is a hassle and so, I got the idea of creating Elevate your next generation fitness tracker that will all your fitness tracking needs in one place plus more. This app is targeted for beginner lifters but can also be used by professionals.

            Let us start with the phone application. The phone application is the main database. Here, all the information regarding your fitness, calorie burnt, calories eaten, weight, BMI, BMR, fat %, muscle mass %, bone % and hydration levels will be stored. It will also have a daily, weekly and monthly chart so that you can see your progress. The phone application will also be programmed so that it can count the reps and assess the range of movement along with the speed of each rep with a certain amount of weight. With this information, the app will then provide the accurate data of the calories burned during your strength training session. The app will also consist of a smart progressive overload tracker. It is important to increase weights over time in order to grow and if you grow you stay motivated. So, this progressive overload tracker will assess the speed of the reps and the rep counts itself and will then give the user an idea of when to increase the weight. Most weightlifters suffer because they do not know how or when to overload. This service will be called the Smart Over Loader. The app should be able to do all these using the camera of the phone. The app will also have a calorie counting space where you can store data on all your calorie intake and calories burnt with protein, carbohydrate and fat intake as well. Elevate will come with a phone case that will have a unit in the back that can be used to stick the phone up on a wall or anywhere so that the app can generate and assess all your workouts properly. Elevate also comes with a smart, Bluetooth weight machine that will be connected to the phone app and will help produce results such as body fat %, muscle mass %, water hydration levels, BMR, AMR, bone % and of course your overall weight. Next, Elevate comes with a minimalistic fitness wrist band with sensors underneath. It will have active GPS tracking to count all the steps that you take, your SP02 levels, it will monitor your cardiovascular health as well, track your sleep and monitor your stress levels. These will also be connected to the application itself. Using all these information, the app will then smartly calculate and regulate your calorie intake, progressive overload and your progress depending on whether you are cutting or bulking and help you achieve your dream physique more accurately and you do not every have to be confused on what to do at the gym. The app will help you understand how much calories you are burning in one day so for example if you are bulking and you burn 1800 calories every day, in order to grow you will need to have a calorie surplus, so you must eat more than 1800 calories. It will help you keep track your fitness and will be your best friend or shall I say, GYMBRO.

            The phone app will use the Jawbone UP which is an open-source tool that measures the number of steps taken. It will also have Foodspex that allows you to count your calories. The smart wrist band should have GPS to monitor your steps in real time using your location. Bioimpedance sensors that collects your heart rate and all that jazz. A barometric altimeter that measures the altitude and the atmospheric pressure. Gyroscopes to calculate orientation an ECG monitor for your heart rates. Skin response sensors to calculate stress levels and body temperature. The weight machine should have metal electrodes underneath that will help collect all bio data through electricity and last but not least all these services have to have Bluetooth connectivity in order to work as an ecosystem.
            A production team is required to produce these services along with that, a programmer who knows python will be needed in order to create the rep counters and the range of motion monitors and suggestions on progressive overload in the app itself. Other raw materials such as metals, different types of radiation are also required to make the wrist bands and the smart scale. And of course, a lot of labor force will be needed as well.
            If the project is successful a handful of the population might get into fitness and might solve their confusion on how to grow or cut back. This a problem, I myself as a fitness enthusiast face and if the world gets fitter, discipline will automatically come into your life and discipline and fitness also helps with your mental health and to lead and prosper to a good life. A fit life.
